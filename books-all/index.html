   <p>‘The Unexamined Life is not worth living’. This statement, attributed to Socrates, has been a guiding principle of my life. It has always seemed to me that the search for the true values and purposes of human life, if any could be found, was of ultimate importance.</p>
   <p>I have been lucky enough to spend my working life in British Universities teaching philosophy, which I see as such a search. This led me to study world religions, which offer various approaches to the search.</p>
   <p>I have taught in seven universities, two major posts being Professor of the History and Philosophy of Religion at King’s College, London University and Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford University. This has given me the opportunity to learn much about many philosophical and religious movements.</p>
   <p>I am also ordained as a minister of the Episcopal (Anglican) Church, so I do have a particular religious belief. This does not mean that I reject all other beliefs. On the contrary, I have found in many religions valuable guidance for the human search for meaning, and I have written many books exploring what can be found of great value – though unfortunately also some things that can be harmful - in the religious and philosophical systems of the world.</p>
   <p>I have compiled a list of all the books I have written, in chronological order. Between them, they cover eight different, but related, topics.</p>
   <ol>
     <li>
       <p>1. <strong>Expositions of Personal Idealism</strong>. This is the view that mind or conscious experience is the basis of all human knowledge, and of reality itself. A key text here is ‘The Priority of Mind’.</p>
     </li>
   </ol>
   <p>2. <strong>The idea of God</strong>, as the supreme mind, knowing all possible and actual things, the source of all values, and a creative and responsive intelligence. Its purpose is the actualisation of a rich and diverse set of values, and a dynamic relation to a universe of finite creative and autonomous persons. Through a long evolutionary process of struggle and endeavour, the aim is that such persons will ultimately achieve conscious union with the supreme mind. ‘The Christian Idea of God’ sets out this view.</p>
   <p>3. <strong>The relation of morality and God</strong> – there can certainly be morality without God, but God grounds a morality which is objectively demanding, enabling, forgiving, and whose goals are assured of achievement. ‘The Development of Kant’s View of Ethics’ (the study of Kant helped me to form my view) and ‘Ethics and Christianity’ are key texts.</p>
   <p>4. <strong>The exposition of a systematic Christian theology</strong>, defending the ideas of Creation, the Trinity, the Incarnation, Atonement, and Eschatology, but using new scientific knowledge and the philosophy of Idealism to build an original system. ‘Spirituality and Christian Belief’ gives a short and non-technical outline, while ‘Karl Barth On Religion: a Critique’ is a more technical defence of a liberal theology against his criticisms</p>
   <p>5. <strong>Science and Religion</strong>. Showing that good science is the friend of good religion, against modern writers who have claimed that the two are incompatible. ‘Why There Almost Certainly a God’ is a short and lively read, while ‘Pascal’s Fire’ gives a more scholarly account.</p>
   <p>6. <strong>World Religions</strong>. Religions seek to establish beneficial relations with spiritual powers. Many religions offer ‘revelations’ of the nature and purposes of these powers. These revelations are influenced by the history and context of their cultures, and generally show some limiting factors arising from such cultures, but many of them contain insights that are of spiritual value. I suggest that each religion can be either ‘closed’, claiming unique and total truth, or ‘open’, allowing for change, diversity, and positive relations with other beliefs, so far as is possible. ‘Religion in the Modern World’ may be of interest, and ‘Concepts of God’ is also relevant.</p>
   <p>7. <strong>The nature of Biblical</strong> (and more generally religious) <strong>language</strong> – metaphor, symbol, and parable. Studies of how Scriptural imagery is used, and of how literalist accounts can be very misleading. ‘Love is His Meaning’ looks at Jesus’ recorded life and teaching as an example.</p>
   <p>8. <strong>Devotional</strong>. I have written a few books primarily intended for members of Anglican parishes I have worked in. ‘The Mystery of Christ’ is an example.</p>
   <p></p>
   <p>My general aim has been to develop a positive view of religion which is fully conversant with the best of modern science and with changes in moral thought which clearly aim at human well-being and fulfilment. I have also tried to suggest an understanding of my own faith, Christianity, which embraces many of the insights of European Enlightenment thinking, without losing sight of other and older traditions of thought.</p>

   <p><strong>Christ and the Cosmos</strong> (2015)</p>
   <p>Part of a trilogy setting out a systematic theology (actually the second volume, but written first). This volume presents Christ as the cosmic pattern and all-including goal of the universe, manifest in human form on this planet in Jesus of Nazareth; and expounds the Trinity as three inseparable aspects of one God</p>
   <p><strong>Re-thinking Order</strong> (2016) edited with Nancy Cartwright</p>
   <p>A collection of essays, mostly by scientists, challenging the notion of absolute laws of nature, and offering different views of natural order in the cosmos</p>

   <p><strong>The Mystery of Christ</strong> (2018)</p>
   <p>An exposition of Christ as portrayed in the Gospels, especially the Gospel of John. Intended to be a devotional as well as a theological work, it contains short meditations and prayers on the main themes discussed.</p>

   <p>How I was converted by a fundamentalist Christian group, and progressed (or regressed, they would say) to a liberal Christian faith.</p>
   <p><strong>Sharing in the Divine Nature</strong> (2020)</p>
   <p>The third part of my systematic theology trilogy. It deals with the idea of the goal of all things as a union of partly self-shaped persons and of created intrinsic values working towards a sharing of all things ‘in heaven and earth’ in the nature of God.</p>
   <p><strong>The Priority of Mind</strong> (2021)</p>
   <p>A philosophical presentation of the view that the ultimate reality is mind, and that matter is its expression and the medium which makes possible communities of beings with finite knowledge, feeling, and action. This is personal idealism, which is not confined to but is found in many Christian theologies.</p>
   <p><strong>My Theology – Personal Idealism</strong> (2021)</p>
   <p>A short book in a series by many theologians called ‘my theology’. In my case, it shows how the philosophy of personal Idealism can be a foundation for Christian faith.</p>

   <p>The parables of Jesus, arranged and expounded so as to express a theology of divine demand, judgment, forgiveness, reconciliation, and universal fulfilment.</p>
   <p><strong>Adventures in Belief</strong> (2022)</p>
   <p>An autobiography of a life in which most things seem to have happened by accident - or could it be some sort of providence?</p>
   <p><strong>Spirituality and Christian Belief</strong> (2024)</p>
   <p>How to see Christian faith as a spiritual way of fulfilment, not an authoritarian set of dogmas.</p>
   <p><strong>Karl Barth on Religion: a Critique</strong> (2024)</p>
   <p>This is a detailed critique of Barth’s writings on religion in his ‘Church Dogmatics’, vol. one/two. I do not deny that Barth has had a remarkable effect on modern Christian thought. But I also think it has been harmful in some ways, especially in its attacks on philosophy and liberal theology. This book aims to show that these attacks are based on some major theological misunderstandings, which I consider in detail.</p>
   <p><strong>God and Faith</strong>; ed. Ian S. Markham and J. D. Bauman (2025)</p>
   <p>7 essays by theologians who are sympathetic to yet critical of my work, with short (and grateful) responses by me – intended by the editors as a research seminar textbook.</p>
